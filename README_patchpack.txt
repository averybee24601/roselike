PATCHPACK — ROSE-like Add‑ons for index_merged_v4.html

These patches are designed for Cursor (or manual copy/paste). Each patch file contains
very clear "FIND → INSERT AFTER/BEFORE" anchors so Cursor can merge automatically.

Order to apply:
  1) patch5_junon_travel.html      — Adds Junon Polis + ferry travel + simple city layout
  2) patch6_stats_altA.html        — STR/DEX/INT scaling, Alt+A to open Stats/Skills, Lv10 skill gate
  3) patch7_moldy_golem.html       — Moldies (normal/elite), Rock Golem + drops + sprites
  4) patch8_graphics_touchups.html — Small visual polish; keeps your existing style

After merging, hard refresh (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R).

Tips:
- The anchors are phrases that already exist in your file.
- If Cursor asks where to insert, choose the obvious match.
- If a patch says "optional", skip it if you prefer your current visuals.
