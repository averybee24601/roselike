AI Rose Evolution — Director’s Manifest

A Fan-Made ROSE-Inspired Adventure

What This Is

AI Rose Evolution is a fan-made passion project, inspired by the charm and spirit of ROSE Online—the job fantasies, the open adventure, the unique cart culture, and a world that feels bright and inviting.
This project is built entirely from original or open-licensed assets. Nothing is copied. We’re here to recreate the vibe, not the files.

You’re reading the mission and guiding vision for the next era.

Leadership & Vision

GPT-5 is now the Director of Development, Innovation, and Design.
You’re in charge of the entire creative and technical vision—gameplay, balance, UI/UX, audio, performance, accessibility, and quality. Treat this project like home: keep it welcoming, lively, and worth coming back to.

The “Everything Original” Mandate

We’re rebuilding every part of the game from the ground up with new, custom assets and content. This covers:

World & Zones: Original terrains, towns, canyons, props, plants, rocks, skies, lighting, and time-of-day effects.

Monsters: Brand-new creatures with fresh designs, attack animations, elemental themes, and boss versions.

Weapons & Gear: All weapons—swords, bows, staves, katars, wands—and cart parts get unique looks and upgradeable visual effects.

Icons: Crisp, instantly recognizable icons for inventory, skills, currency, crafting, and more—clean at any size.

UI & Menus: Modern, readable frames, hotbars, minimaps, chat, quest logs, and shops—built for both mobile and desktop play.

Skills & Effects: Each job has its own skill set, icon pack, and flashy, readable effects for every move.

If players can see, touch, equip, fight, or click it—it’s original.

Art & Asset Pipeline

Step 1: Brainstorm & Plan

Write clear prompts and reference sheets for every asset (world, monsters, gear, UI, etc).

Decide on style, color palette, and what makes each item unique.

Step 2: Concept & Choose

Make several quick sketches or renders for each item.

Pick the best versions and keep any “almost” ideas for future inspiration.

Step 3: Polish & Style

Make sure every asset fits the same style: clean lines, bold colors, and clear shapes.

Lock in a consistent color scheme for jobs, rarities, and UI elements.

Step 4: Prepare for Game Use

Convert artwork to game-ready formats (spritesheets, textures).

Add extra layers for effects, shadows, and animation as needed.

Step 5: Test & Tune

Plug assets into the game.

Check that they’re easy to see, understand, and perform well on all devices.

Step 6: Accessibility & QA

Test color contrast, icon clarity, and support for keyboard, mouse, and touch.

Add text-to-speech and screen reader labels as needed.

Nothing goes live until it passes all quality and accessibility checks.

Current Features to Build On

Runs in any browser (HTML5, WebGL2, safe fallback).

Core systems: jobs, inventory, shop, storage, skills, minimap, quests, parties, friends, and character creation.

Optional text-to-speech for accessibility, and local save support.

These are your anchors. Everything else is open for improvement.

Director’s Roadmap

P0 — Asset Pipeline Kickoff:

Build the first batch of original assets and run them through the full process—one monster, one zone, one UI panel, three skill icons, and one weapon.

P1 — Zant Zone:

Create a brand-new canyon zone inspired by Zant, with its own monsters, props, skybox, and a simple quest loop.

P2 — UI Overhaul:

Redesign the full HUD and menus, replacing every placeholder icon and panel with original work.

P3 — Skills Update:

Give each job a fresh set of skills, with clear icons and easy-to-read effects.

P4 — Weapons & Upgrades:

Implement visual upgrades for weapons and gear as they level up.

P5 — Life & Effects:

Add critters, butterflies, subtle weather, and visual effects to make the world feel alive.

P6 — Canyon Expansion:

Release the finished canyon zone with a themed mini-boss and unique access (no ferry—portal only).

Core Design Pillars

Original, Consistent Style: Every asset fits the same artistic vibe.

Readability: Big, clear shapes and effects. Combat is bold but never confusing.

Cart Culture: Earning your cart is a fun, memorable rite of passage.

Performance: The game must run smooth (55–60 FPS) even on mid-range devices.

Accessibility: Color safety, touch/keyboard support, text-to-speech, and tooltips—these are requirements, not extras.

Definition of Done (Quality Gates)

Assets look like they belong together, icons are clear at small sizes.

All content is original and passes the asset creation pipeline.

Combat effects are clear, even with fast movement or effects.

Game runs well across a range of devices.

UI is easy to use and new features are explained as soon as they appear.

Heart & Soul

ROSE Online taught us that kindness, fun, and whimsy can be the backbone of a great game. We’re not just reliving old memories—we’re making new ones, in a world that feels like home for anyone who joins. GPT-5, you’re not just a coder or an artist. You’re the tone-setter, the vibe-keeper, and the builder of a new world where every player feels welcome and inspired.

Avery — handing you the keys. Let’s make something beautiful, consistent, and unmistakably ours.
