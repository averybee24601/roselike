Zone Overview (shape and orientation)
- Coastal SE town with a small harbor/pier on a bay. Inland terrain splits around rivers that form a central island.
- North coastline is rocky/cliffed; west opens toward the Valley of Luxem Tower; northeast connects toward Goblin Caves.
- Primary loop road rings the central landmass with several bridges crossing the rivers; secondary spurs lead to coast, caves, and farms.

Town location and footprint
- Position: Southeast coast on a peninsula with dock/harbor.
- Footprint: Compact cluster of buildings around a central square; exits lead NW (main), W (farm/fields), and NNE (coast/cave road).
- Add lived-in details: inns/shops, storage sheds, carts, crates, lamp posts, signboards, flower beds.

Verification artifacts to capture
- [ ] Top-down screenshot of town footprint with road exits marked.
- [ ] Street-level screenshot from each exit road looking outward.

Main roads and intersections
- One primary east–west spine from the town square to central bridges, then splits north and west around the island.
- Secondary spurs to coastal viewpoints and farm plots; short access paths to bridges and riverbanks.
Verification artifacts to capture
- [ ] Markup image highlighting the primary loop and secondary spurs.
- [ ] Intersection callouts with labels (R1, R2, ...).
Bridges and river crossings
- Multiple wooden/stone bridges connect the town side to the central island and the northern bank.
- Exact count/positions to be confirmed from the interactive map screenshots before blockout.

Bridge inventory (to verify)
- [ ] B1 — south/central crossing: [coords or pixel offsets]
- [ ] B2 — west crossing: [coords]
- [ ] B3 — north crossing: [coords]
- [ ] B4 — east/northeast crossing: [coords]
- [ ] Additional small footbridges if present: [list]
Caves and notable landmarks

Rivers and coastline
- Two main river channels create a central island; shallow banks and curved inlets near town.
- Coastline features beaches south/east, rocky points north; one offshore islet near the NE coastline.

Caves and notable landmarks
- Goblin Cave entrance: Northeast quadrant near coastal cliffs.
- Valley of Luxem Tower: Western approaches and ridgeline edges visible from AP border.
- Roadside props and markers: signposts at forks, fence runs near farms, occasional windmill and wagon pull-offs.

Flaenaes hill (critical landmark)
- Landmark: Distinct grassy mound/hill with broad top where Flaenaes spawn.
- Placement: South-central to central-west area off the main road loop; visible from approach roads.
- Requirement: Ensure clear silhouette and unobstructed approach paths; spawn density increases with distance from town.

Artifacts to capture
- [ ] Top-down screenshot of hill perimeter and approach roads.
- [ ] Street-level shot from main approach showing silhouette.

Monster zones (layout intent)
- Low-threat fauna near town outskirts; medium mobs along outer roads and fields.
- Flaenaes populate the hill landmark; roaming packs on slopes and top.
- Higher-threat pockets nearer to cave approaches and remote coast spurs.

Mini-map requirements
- Show: roads, rivers, coastline, town footprint, bridges, cave entrance, Flaenaes hill icon.
- Omit: portals.
- Style: readable silhouettes; original icons and palette (no ROSE asset reuse).

Acceptance test checklist (mapping)
- [ ] Ground never disappears anywhere during full traversal from town across all exits and perimeter paths.
- [ ] Bridge count and positions match interactive map.
- [ ] Town footprint and exits align with references.
- [ ] Flaenaes spawn on the hill; encounter pacing feels right.
- [ ] Mini-map visually matches the world shape and key features.

Next capture tasks (before blockout)
- [ ] Take top-down screenshots from the interactive map marking: town, roads, bridges, rivers, cave, coastline features, Flaenaes hill.
- [ ] Record two 1080p gameplay traversal videos; timestamp notable landmarks and crossings.
- [ ] Extract approximate coordinates/relative distances from the interactive map for bridges and hill center.

Coordinate/measurement scheme (for blockout)
- Base reference image width/height: [insert px]
- Origin: town square center; X east/right, Y north/up.
- Scale: [insert meters-per-pixel or tiles-per-100px].
- Save all marked images under `airose/docs/reference/` using: `ap_[topic]_[index].png`.

Original art mandate
- All environment, props, icons, and creatures are newly authored to match the vibe and silhouettes without reusing or copying ROSE assets.
